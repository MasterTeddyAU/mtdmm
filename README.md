# Multiple TeamDrive Mounting Method

I needed to have multiple teamdrives mounted on my box. I am not a clever man. Some guy in a discord took the time to talk me through it and I'm paying it forward for anyone it helps. 

This isn't a copy and paste guide, so please read through and understand what you're doing before pumping anything into your box. Eventually I'd like to automate this process and script it. But as stated above, I am not a clever man, and this may take some time.
