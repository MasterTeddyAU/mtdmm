# Multiple Teamdrive Mounting Method

I needed to have multiple teamdrives mounted on my box. I am not a clever man. Some guy in a discord took the time to talk me through it and I'm paying it forward for anyone it helps. 

This isn't a copy and paste guide, so please read through and understand what you're doing before pumping anything into your box.
